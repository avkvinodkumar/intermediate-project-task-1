Here's a possible description for a GitHub repository for the customer churn prediction project:

**Title:** Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

**Description:**

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. The project uses a dataset of customer demographics, usage data, and communication patterns to build a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn.

**Features:**

* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
* Model selection and training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines)
* Model evaluation and validation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
* Deployment of the trained model in a production environment

** Files**:

data_preprocessing.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing and feature engineering code
feature_selection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing feature selection and dimensionality reduction code
model_training.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing model selection and training code
model_evaluation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing model evaluation and validation code
model_deployment.py: Python script containing the deployed model code
requirements.txt: File listing dependencies required to run the project



**Dependencies:**

* Python 3.8+
* pandas
* scikit-learn

   This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using machine learning. The project uses a dataset of customer demographics, usage data, and communication patterns to build a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn.

Dataset Description:

The dataset used for this project consists of:

10,000 rows
12 columns (customer_id, age, tenure, plan_type, data_usage, voice_minutes, text_messages, email_communication, churned)
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
Preprocessing:

The preprocessing steps included in this project are:

Handling missing values by imputing them with mean or median values
One-hot encoding categorical variables (plan_type)
Scaling numerical variables using StandardScaler
Feature Engineering:

The feature engineering steps included in this project are:

Calculating average data usage per month
Calculating average voice minutes per month
Calculating average text messages sent per month
Creating a feature indicating the number of times the customer has received emails from the service provider
Model Selection and Training:

The models trained in this project include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines
The models were trained using the training set and evaluated using the testing set. The best-performing model is selected based on F1-score.

Model Evaluation:

The model evaluation metrics used in this project are:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
The best-performing model is evaluated using these metrics and compared to the baseline model (Logistic Regression).
